Their phones can only pick brief and perplexing bits of conversation. The radio is filled with static - although occasional, broken-up bits of news are heard - reports of some sort of global catastrophe... A ninth person arrives, hiking to the diner from his stranded car, where he had been listening to his car radio. He informs the others that, yes, from what he was been able to make out, something alarming seems to have happened, a catastrophe on a global scale\x85 Oh, and one more bit of local news he happened to pick up, he says: The previous night an inmate escaped from a nearby hospital for the criminally insane, after killing his doctor and several bystanders. The police warn that he is very, very dangerous... What perhaps sounds like the description of an old weird tale or an episode of The Twilight Zone is actually just the beginning of the new suspenseful, brain-twisting graphic novel from the author of Delphine, The Chuckling Whatsit, and Cat Burglar Black. In The Hidden, as the isolated characters become increasingly unraveled, one character tells of a dream he recently had. Then each of the others tells a dream, a personal anecdote or a story they've heard, ranging from the bizarre to the absurd to the truly horrific. Each will be presented as its own chapter. Then there are the games - a selection of (fully illustrated) card games and board games found in the diner.  Are these merely children's games - or something more sinister?", "AUG121149"=>"Approximate Continuum Comics brings American readers the first portion of the 'Trondheim autobio trilogy' that also comprises the Eisner-nominated 'At Loose Ends' meditation serialized in Mome (which will be released as a graphic novel in 2012) and the ongoing 'Little Nothings' series of short slice-of-life stories (three to date from NBM Publishing), as well as the first three chapters serialized in the Nimrod comic book. In Approximate Continuum Comics, Trondheim's typically graceful, confident cartooning shows him wrestling with his own demons (sometimes, in dream sequences, literally) and an often malevolent world, while trying to maintain his rising career as one of Europe's most beloved cartoonists.

Weathercraft is Woodring's first full-length graphic novel set in this world-indeed, Woodring's first graphic novel, period!-and it features the same hypnotically gorgeous linework and mystical iconography. As it happens, Frank has only a brief supporting appearance in Weathercraft, which actually stars Manhog, Woodring's pathetic, brutish everyman (or everyhog), who had previously made several appearances in 'Frank' stories (as well as a stunning solo turn in the short story 'Gentlemanhog'). After enduring 32 pages of almost incomprehensible suffering, Manhog embarks upon a transformative journey and attains enlightenment. He wants to go to celestial realms but instead altruistically returns to the Unifactor to undo a wrong he has inadvertently brought about: The transformation of the evil politician Whim into a mind-destroying plant-demon who distorts and enslaves Frank and his friends. The new and metaphysically expanded Manhog sets out for a final battle with Whim... Weathercraft also co-stars Frank's cast of beloved supporting characters, including Frank's Faux Pa and the diminutive, mailbox-like Pupshaw and Pushpaw; it is both a fully independent story that is a great introduction to Woodring's world, and a sublime addition to, and extension of, the Frank stories. Weathercraft will be a defining graphic novel of 2010.", "AUG121153"=>"By Lilli Carre A HAUNTING, LYRICAL GRAPHIC NOVEL DEBUT  A family is seduced by the song of the Creature from the Black Lagoon in talented young cartoonist Lilli Carr\xE9's first long-form work, and how each member reacts to the Creature's siren call in The Lagoon is the crux of the story. For the wise - or pixilated - Grandpa, the song reminds him that, in the time he has left, he must pause to respect, appreciate, and fear nature. The song hints at something that Zoey, the daughter, is too young to fully grasp. And the song lures the sexually frustrated mother, and eventually, her husband, into danger\x85Carr\xE9 experimented with nib pens and brushes while drawing this black-and-white graphic novel, giving the art a different feel from her previous, Eisner-and-Harvey-Award-nominated story, The Tale of Woodsman Pete. Lagoon was influenced by the films Creature from the Black Lagoon and Night of the Hunter, but reads more like the gothic, family narratives of Flannery O'Connor or Carson McCullers. Rhythms - Grandpa's taps, the ticking of a metronome - are punctuated by silences that pace this 'sound'-driven story. Older teen and adult readers are invited to imagine the enigmatic Creature's haunting, ever-shifting tune as it reverberates through weedy waters, eventually escaping the lagoon to creep into windows at night ", "AUG121154"=>"Gilbert Hernandez's first original graphic novel from Fantagraphics tells the story about a little orphan girl who lives in the slum of slums.  Nobody knows who she is or where she's from, but her fellow shantytown inhabitants collectively look over her.  The three-act story follows our heroine as she is adopted by a decent man who raises her well, and she eventually marries a kind, well-to-do man, only to discover that she can't relate to the good life and the comforts it provides.

Hundred twenty-eight pounds. Forty-three twenty-two thirty-six. High soft lisp. Genius level I.Q.' That's how motivational speaker Mark Herrera sums up Rosalba 'Fritz' Martinez, bombshell, former punkette, former psychiatrist, 'Z' movie star - in this supremely sexy, constantly surprising graphic novel.  And Herrera should know, being only one of many to fall under Fritz's 'lithping' spell - others including slobbish rocker Scott 'The Hog' and high school nerd turned obsessive bodybuilder Enrique Escobar (and that's just her husbands).  Hernandez has taken this suite of stories (including the 48-page graphic novelette 'High Soft Lisp'), originally serialized in the second volume of Love and Rockets, and fleshed them out with a dozen brand new pages, creating an original and inventive (and very steamy) volume that, through its connections to his main character Luba (Fritz is Luba's half sister, and characters from the Luba stories pop up here), works both as a standalone graphic novel and a further exploration of Hernandez's rich world.
